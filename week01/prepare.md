> What is a version control system and why is it important?

Version control systems save code and allow changes to be made incrementally to separate parts of the code. When developing on your own, this is useful as a "history" tool, allowing you to view and revert back to your previous changes.

It becomes even more useful when used in a team. Multiple people can change different parts of the code without worrying about overwriting other's work. Multiple people can work on the same piece of code and merge those changes together without fear of breaking things.
