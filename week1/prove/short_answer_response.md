> How did you use a version control system to develop the programs?

The entire project lives in version control!

I used `$ git init` to create the repo. I created a `/week01` directory to store this week's project, and uploaded all the files using multiple `$ git add` and `$ git commit -m "week01: <something>"` commands.

If I decide to add more features later, I will edit the file, then use `$ git add tictactoe.py` and `$ git commit -m "week01(prove): Add <feature> to TicTacToe assignment"` to add it to the version control.
